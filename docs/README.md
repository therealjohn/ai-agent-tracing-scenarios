# AI Agent Tracing Scenarios

This user study guides you through hands-on scenarios to learn AI agent tracing using the AI Toolkit's Tracing Viewer in VS Code.

## What is AI Tracing?

AI tracing captures detailed execution information as your AI application runs, helping you:

- **Debug Complex Workflows**: Track data flow through multi-step AI processes
- **Monitor Performance**: Analyze response times, token usage, and costs
- **Ensure Quality**: Validate AI behavior and catch issues early
- **Audit Decisions**: Maintain records for compliance and accountability

## Common Use Cases

- **Multi-agent Systems**: Track interactions between AI agents
- **RAG Applications**: Monitor retrieval, generation, and augmentation steps
- **AI Pipelines**: Observe data flow through processing chains
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of AI applications

## Study Overview

You'll work through 6 progressive scenarios, each designed to teach specific tracing concepts. Each scenario includes a task to complete using the Tracing Viewer to analyze AI application behavior.

**Time**: 2-3 hours total (20-30 minutes per scenario)
