# AI Agent Tracing Scenarios

## What is AI Tracing?

Understanding why your AI agent made specific decisions is crucial for debugging, but can be challenging due to:

- **Complex execution paths** with many steps that vary based on input
- **Lengthy inputs/outputs** requiring detailed inspection  
- **Nested operations** where agents invoke tools that trigger other processes

Tracing addresses these challenges by providing clear visibility into each step's inputs, outputs, and execution order.

## Study Overview

You'll work through 6 progressive scenarios, each designed to evaluate the AI Toolkit Tracing Viewer. Each scenario includes a task to complete using the Tracing Viewer to analyze AI application behavior.
