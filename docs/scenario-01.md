# Scenario 1: Basic AI Tracing

Learn how AI tracing captures agent interactions through a simple chain of reasoning.

## Running This Scenario

1. **Switch to the scenario branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_01
   ```

2. **Verify the tracing viewer is running:**
   - Open the AI Toolkit panel (View → Open View → AI Toolkit)
   - Click on "Traces" to open the Tracing Viewer
   - Ensure the viewer is ready to capture traces

3. **Run the scenario:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the traces:**
   - Return to the Tracing Viewer in the AI Toolkit panel
   - Find the traces from your execution
   - Complete the task below

## Your Task

Observe how the tracing viewer captures:
- Agent interactions and responses
- Token usage and timing
- Multi-step reasoning chains

## Understanding the Code

This scenario demonstrates a basic AI agent performing a chain of reasoning tasks. The tracing shows how each step is captured and visualized.

## Next Steps

When you're ready, continue to the next scenario.
