# Scenario 2: Function Calling

Explore how AI tracing tracks function calls and tool usage in agent workflows.

## Running This Scenario

1. **Switch to the scenario branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_02
   ```

2. **Verify the tracing viewer is running:**
   - Open the AI Toolkit panel (View → Open View → AI Toolkit)
   - Click on "Traces" to open the Tracing Viewer
   - Ensure the viewer is ready to capture traces

3. **Run the scenario:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the traces:**
   - Return to the Tracing Viewer in the AI Toolkit panel
   - Examine the function call patterns
   - Complete the task below

## Your Task

Observe how the tracing viewer shows:
- Function calls made by the agent
- Parameters passed to functions
- Return values and execution flow

## Understanding the Code

This scenario demonstrates an AI agent using function calling capabilities. The tracing reveals how tool usage is monitored and visualized.
