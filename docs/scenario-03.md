# Scenario 3: Error Handling

Learn how AI tracing helps debug and monitor error conditions in agent workflows.

## Running This Scenario

1. **Switch to the scenario branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_03
   ```

2. **Verify the tracing viewer is running:**
   - Open the AI Toolkit panel (View → Open View → AI Toolkit)
   - Click on "Traces" to open the Tracing Viewer
   - Ensure the viewer is ready to capture traces

3. **Run the scenario:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the traces:**
   - Return to the Tracing Viewer in the AI Toolkit panel
   - Focus on error handling and recovery patterns
   - Complete the task below

## Your Task

Observe how the tracing viewer captures:
- Error conditions and exceptions
- Recovery attempts and fallback strategies
- Impact on overall agent performance
