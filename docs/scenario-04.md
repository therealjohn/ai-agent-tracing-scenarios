# Scenario 4: Complex Workflows

Explore advanced AI tracing with multi-agent interactions and complex decision trees.

## Running This Scenario

1. **Switch to the scenario branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_04
   ```

2. **Verify the tracing viewer is running:**
   - Open the AI Toolkit panel (View → Open View → AI Toolkit)
   - Click on "Traces" to open the Tracing Viewer
   - Ensure the viewer is ready to capture traces

3. **Run the scenario:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the traces:**
   - Return to the Tracing Viewer in the AI Toolkit panel
   - Navigate through the complex interaction patterns
   - Complete the task below

## Your Task

Observe how the tracing viewer handles:
- Multi-agent interactions
- Complex decision trees and branching logic
- Performance bottlenecks in longer workflows

## Understanding the Code

This scenario demonstrates advanced agent workflows with multiple decision points and interactions, showing how tracing scales with complexity.
