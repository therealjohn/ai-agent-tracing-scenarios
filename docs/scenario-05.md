# Scenario 5: Performance Analysis

Dive deep into performance monitoring and optimization using AI tracing data.

## Running This Scenario

1. **Switch to the scenario branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_05
   ```

2. **Verify the tracing viewer is running:**
   - Open the AI Toolkit panel (View → Open View → AI Toolkit)
   - Click on "Traces" to open the Tracing Viewer
   - Ensure the viewer is ready to capture traces

3. **Run the scenario:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the traces:**
   - Return to the Tracing Viewer in the AI Toolkit panel
   - Focus on performance metrics and timing data
   - Complete the task below
