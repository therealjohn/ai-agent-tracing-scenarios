# Scenario 6: Custom Metrics

Learn to implement and visualize custom metrics in AI agent tracing.

## Running This Scenario

1. **Switch to the scenario branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_06
   ```

2. **Verify the tracing viewer is running:**
   - Open the AI Toolkit panel (View → Open View → AI Toolkit)
   - Click on "Traces" to open the Tracing Viewer
   - Ensure the viewer is ready to capture traces

3. **Run the scenario:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Analyze the traces:**
   - Return to the Tracing Viewer in the AI Toolkit panel
   - Complete the task below

## Your Task

Observe why the document parsing appears to fail using the trace.

## Understanding the Code

This final scenario demonstrates how to extend tracing with custom metrics specific to your AI agent applications, providing deeper insights into application behavior.
