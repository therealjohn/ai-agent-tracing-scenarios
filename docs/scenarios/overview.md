## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

### Prerequisites Complete?
Before starting any scenario, ensure you've completed:
- ‚úÖ [Setup Instructions](../setup.md)
- ‚úÖ Environment activated
- ‚úÖ API configured

### Starting a Scenario

Each scenario follows the same pattern:

1. **Switch to the scenario branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout scenario_XX
   ```

2. **Verify you're on the correct branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch
   # Should show: * scenario_XX
   ```

3. **Review the scenario-specific README**:
   ```bash
   cat README_scenario_XX.md
   # Or open in your editor
   ```

4. **Run the scenario**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Study Tips üí°

### Before Each Scenario
- [ ] Read the scenario overview completely
- [ ] Ensure you're on the correct Git branch
- [ ] Verify your virtual environment is activated
- [ ] Review any prerequisites from previous scenarios

### During Each Scenario
- [ ] Run the code as-is first to see baseline behavior
- [ ] Read through the code to understand the implementation
- [ ] Experiment with modifications
- [ ] Take notes on insights and questions

### After Each Scenario
- [ ] Reflect on what you learned
- [ ] Consider how you'd apply this in your own projects
- [ ] Note any questions for later research
- [ ] Check that you understand the key concepts

## Time Management ‚è∞

### Suggested Schedule

**Option 1: Single Session (2-3 hours)**
- Setup: 15 minutes
- Scenarios 00-02: 1 hour
- Break: 15 minutes  
- Scenarios 03-05: 1.5 hours

**Option 2: Multiple Sessions**
- Session 1: Setup + Scenarios 00-01 (45 minutes)
- Session 2: Scenarios 02-03 (1 hour)
- Session 3: Scenarios 04-05 (1 hour)

**Option 3: Flexible Learning**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues üîß

### Wrong Branch
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout scenario_XX
```

### Missing Files
```bash
# Ensure you're in the right directory
pwd
ls

# Should see main.py and README_scenario_XX.md
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Verify virtual environment is active
# Prompt should show (.venv)

# If not active:
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### API Errors
```bash
# Check environment configuration
python -c "
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
print('Token configured!' if os.getenv('API_CREDENTIAL_TOKEN') else 'Token missing!')
"
```
